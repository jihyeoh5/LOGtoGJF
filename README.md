# LOGtoGJF

When submitting geometry optimization and frequency calculations in the form of a GJF file using the GaussView and Gaussian09 software, a LOG file is produced. The LOG file contains a large amount of data about the submitted calculation. However, to perform another calcultion on this LOG file, it must be submitted again as a GJF file. The LOGtoGJF converter performs this conversion. It extracts data from the LOG file and writes it to a text file in an organized way to form a GJF file.
