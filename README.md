# LOGtoGJF

When submitting geometry optimization and frequency calculations in the form of a GJF file using the GaussView05 and Gaussian09 software, a LOG file is produced. The LOG file contains a large amount of data about the submitted calculation. However, to perform another calculation on this LOG file, it must be submitted again as a GJF file. The LOGtoGJF converter performs this conversion. It extracts data from the LOG file, asks the user for some input, then writes them to a text file in an organized way to produce a GJF file. There are also some additional functions for user convenience such as modifying file names and making new directories.
